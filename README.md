tasks Array: Stores task data (name, deadline, completion status).
addTask: Adds tasks to the list and renders the updated list.
displayTasks: Displays tasks with a button to toggle completion status.
toggleCompletion: Marks tasks as complete or incomplete, updating their display.
clearForm: Clears the input fields after adding a task.
Key Features:
Task Creation: Add tasks with a name and deadline.
Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed (strikethrough, color change).
Dynamic Updates: Task list updates in real time.
